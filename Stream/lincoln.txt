Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

Funeral and burial

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.


Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 
1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.

Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, 
Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, 
but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854.
He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A.
Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. 
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. 
They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, 
one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans,
who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; 
anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. 
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. 
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. 
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, 
encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. 
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. 
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender. 
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. 
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President. 
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant 
at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. 
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. 
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. 
After death his face relaxed into a smile.[113][114][115][116] Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. 
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death.

Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia. Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. 
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. 
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. 
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.
